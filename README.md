## Day 0 (**22<sup>nd</sup> July 2018**):
---
### Progress
+   Collection of Study Material
+   Setup the Programming Environment, i.e, installing dependencies

### Thoughts
Really Excited to learn Machine Learning in a more effective way

## Day 1 (**23<sup>rd</sup> July 2018**):
---
### Progress
+   Learnt about Linear and Logistic Regression
+   Collected Dataset from Kaggle about Breast Cancer
+   Modified the dataset to make use of it and understood the structure of a dataset
+   Trained a logistic regression classifier to predict Breast Cancer to be Maligant or Benign using Naive Bayes
+   Used Scikit Learn Library for Logistic Regression

### Thoughts
It was full of fun, learnt a lot about dealing with **rank 1 arrays** as well as keeping a track on the shape of the matrices.

## Day 2 (**24<sup>th</sup> July 2018**):
---
### Progress
+   Learnt about Vectorization in detail and its importance in Machine Learning practices
+   Completed the Machine Learning Crash Course till **Generalization**

### Thoughts
Now I realized why matrix manipulation is important. Vectorization actually helps a lot and it is the key feature because of which now we are able to run Machine Learning Algorithms much more faster.
